<li>Bug fixes, enhacements, to the Find Duplicate Files functionality.
	</li>
<li>Clicking on the app icon (from the Dock) will bring up the main window if none is visible. This behavior is similar to Apple's Finder.
	</li>
<li>The check for updates setting on the Preferences Window now sticks.
	</li>
<li>When measuring or refreshing a folder under PieChart the User Interface will refresh itself.
	</li>
<li>Added menu item to reset the Find Duplicates database.

<li>More accurate time estimates when building the duplicates database.
	</li>
<li>Added support for multiple seat keys. You need to purchase one of these if you plan to use the software on more than 3 machines.
	</li>
<li>Added key validation to our website servers. At this time we check only for blacklisted keys, which is always a problem. We allow a one seat key to be used in up to 3 machines. If the key is blacklisted the software will revert to demo mode.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<li>Updates. Free to all users. DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU ARE USING MAC OSX 10.3. Recommended to all Users.</li>
<li>Added Duplicate Files functionality. We consider two files to be duplicates if they have the same md5 hash value. Figuring out the md5 hashes can be a long and expensive operation, so we will build the hash values in the background and store them into a database for convenience. If the files are modified the md5 hashes will be recalculated. You'd be suprised at how many duplicate files are out there.
	</li>
<li>We will skip the following file names: .svn, build, cvs, *.app, *.framework, *.bundle, */library/caches/ 
                        We plan to allow for more control in a future release using a preference panel.
	</li>
<li>Fixed SnowLeopard bug crash related to Java.

<li>Fixed SnowLeopard file size math. In SnowLeopard one KB is 1000 so Apple went to multiples of 1000 rather than multiples of 1024 when displaying the compact file size.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<li>Updates. Free to all users. DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU ARE USING MAC OSX 10.3. Recommended to all Users.</li>
<li>Thanks to support from our customers we have spent a lot of time to make this simple app even more useful. This is a Free update.
	</li>
<li>Multiple fixes under the hood have been made to improve the integrity of measurements. One example is that Finder ignores the Folder size. Folders just like Files take disk space, they store information about the Files/Folders they contain. This information is managed by the Operating System. Our measurements will appear larger than those from Finder, but will be a bit more accurate.
	</li>
<li>The app will consult with the file system to prevent existing measurements from going stale.
	</li>
<li>The local Trash icon gets updated in real time when moving items to the Trash.
	</li>
<li>We now allow users to move items to the Trash as Administrator, but only items that reside under /Users. This is done to prevent removal of critical Files by mistake. We plan to enhance this feature in a future release.
	</li>
<li>There are now contextual menus to sort as well as Export a selection of files as csv for further processing.
	</li>
<li>We now display the File/Folder icons.
	</li>
<li>The app will remember the last sort function and use it on the next launch.
	</li>
<li>Due to popular demand the main window will display a tool bar. All tool bar functions are accessible using menu short cuts.
	</li>
<li>We have added the ability to refresh just one node, recursively. This function gets kicked automatically when on Browser View and the folder clicked has been updated since the last time it was measured.
	</li>
<li>There is better feedback when moving items to the Trash fails.
